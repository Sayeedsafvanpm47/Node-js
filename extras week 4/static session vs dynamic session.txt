Statically Typed Sessions (Server-Side Sessions):

    Statically typed sessions, in the context of web development, refer to sessions where the data types of session variables are explicitly declared and fixed in advance.
    In such sessions, you define the data types for each session variable when setting them up. Once a session variable is declared with a specific data type, it cannot be changed during the session's lifetime.
    Statically typed sessions are more common in languages and frameworks that enforce strong typing, such as Java with the HttpSession object.

Example (Java Servlets - Statically Typed Session):

java

// Statically typed session variable with an explicitly declared data type
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("count", 42); // Integer type

Dynamically Typed Sessions (Dynamic Sessions):

    Dynamically typed sessions refer to sessions where session variables do not have fixed data types and can change their data types during the session's lifetime.
    In dynamically typed sessions, you do not need to declare the data type of session variables explicitly. You can set a session variable as one data type and later change it to a different data type if needed.
    Dynamically typed sessions are more common in languages and frameworks that do not enforce strict data typing, such as JavaScript with Express.js.

Example (Node.js with Express - Dynamically Typed Session):

javascript

// Dynamically typed session variable without an explicitly declared data type
req.session.username = "john"; // Initially, a string
req.session.username = 42;     // Later, changed to an int
