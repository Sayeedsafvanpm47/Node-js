Axios is a popular JavaScript library that allows you to make HTTP requests from both browsers and Node.js applications. It provides a simple and consistent API for sending HTTP requests and handling responses. Axios is widely used for making HTTP requests to external APIs, fetching data from servers, and interacting with web services in both browser-based and server-side JavaScript applications.

Key features and capabilities of Axios in Node.js include:

    Promise-Based: Axios is promise-based, which means it uses JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous operations. This makes it easy to work with asynchronous code and handle responses using .then() and .catch().

    HTTP Methods: Axios supports various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. You can easily specify the method you want to use when making requests.

    Request and Response Interceptors: Axios allows you to define request and response interceptors, enabling you to add custom logic before requests are sent or after responses are received. This is useful for tasks like authentication and error handling.

    Request Configuration: Axios provides a wide range of options for configuring requests, such as headers, query parameters, request data, timeout settings, and more.

    Response Handling: Axios automatically parses JSON responses and provides a convenient way to access response data. You can also handle other response types, such as text or binary data.

    Request Cancellation: Axios supports request cancellation, allowing you to cancel pending requests when they are no longer needed.

    Progress Events: Axios can emit progress events for uploads and downloads, making it suitable for applications that require progress tracking.
